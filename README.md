# Kickstarter
Repository for the module 1 challenge
## Overview of Project
In this project, I analyzed the likelihood that a project would succeed, fail, or cancel based on the category that the project falls under, more specifically, theater, and based on the amount required to execute the project (goal amount).
## Purpose
The purpose is to assist Louise in predicting a likely outcome for a project that she launched recently for her play Fever. The analysis is rooted in the category of her project as well as providing support based on the amount required for a successful project.
## Analysis and Challenges
Generally speaking, an analysis of the data shows that successful project are launched in the late spring and summertime and also if their goal amounts are smaller. While I had no difficulties executing the analysis of the project, some difficulties that others might encounter would have to do with different formula syntax errors, or perhaps setting up the proper charts for visualizing data.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

This image is a visualization of the theater outcomes based on the launch date of a project. Based on the graph, most theater projects are executed in the spring and summer months, particularly April, May, June, and July and tapers off significately toward the end of the year, particularly in November and December. While the number of projects canceled holds steady year round, a project is most likely to succeed in the spring and summer months when there is a higher influx of projects all together. And while the project is still more likely to succeed in the winter months than fail, the likelihood of failure is higher.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

This image is a visualization of the likelihood of success, failure, or cancellation based on the goal amount of the project. There are some simple trends laid out in this line graph. The percentage of success shows a downward trend the higher the goal is for the project (negative correlation), while the percentage of failure shows an upward trend the higher the goal is for the project (positive correlation). Also important, the likelihood that a project will be canceled increases the higher the goal is. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Again, while I did not encounter any difficulties, some may encounter syntax errors or issues with setting up the proper visualization.
## Results
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
One conclusion that can be drawn on the outcomes based on launch date is that successful projects happen more frequently in spring and summer months. Another conclusion that can be drawn is that there is a lower success rate for projects that are launched in the late fall and early winter months. Projects are also released more frequently in the spring and summer (when success is higher) and less frequently in the fall and winter months (when success is lower).
### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
That a successful project has a lower goal amount.
### What are some limitations of this database?
In the theater parent group, most of the data comes from the years 2014, 2015, and 2016. So, the significance that this draws over the time period 2009 to 2017 is almost solely drawing from the three years listed above, which is a bit misleading for a user that is looking at this graph with the expectation that this accurately represents the 8 year time frame
### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I think that the Percentage Funded column in the Kickstarter worksheet is underutilized. It would be important to determine how well publicized each project was and determine how much of that lead to the success of that project.
